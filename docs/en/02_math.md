# 📐 2. Math for ML

> Russian version: [02_math.md](../ru/02_math.md)

> **Goal:** not just "know formulas", but **understand** what happens inside models. Yandex/Sber/T-Bank interviews can go deep on math.

## ✅ What you should be able to do by the end

- Explain **in simple words** what SVD is and why it is used in ML
- **Derive** linear regression through least squares by yourself
- Explain how **backpropagation** works through the chain rule
- Design an **A/B test** for a given product case
