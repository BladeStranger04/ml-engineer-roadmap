## 🔍 SQL (Advanced)

- [ ] JOINs (INNER, LEFT, FULL, CROSS, SEMI, ANTI)
- [ ] Window functions: `ROW_NUMBER`, `LAG/LEAD`, `SUM() OVER`
- [ ] CTEs, recursive CTEs
- [ ] Subqueries, EXISTS vs IN
- [ ] Indexes, EXPLAIN, optimization
- [ ] Partitioning, sharding
- [ ] PostgreSQL, ClickHouse (de facto standard in Russia: Yandex Metrica, VK, Avito)

## 🐼 Pandas / Polars / NumPy

- [ ] NumPy: vectorization, broadcasting, fancy indexing
- [ ] Pandas: groupby, merge, pivot, apply vs vectorize
- [ ] Memory optimization (`category`, `int8`)
- [ ] **Polars** — modern Pandas alternative: faster, lazy execution plan
- [ ] EDA: dataset profiling, anomaly search

## 🚀 Big Data Stack

- [ ] **Apache Spark** (PySpark) — main tool in Russian Tier-1 companies
  - DataFrame API, Spark SQL
  - Partitioning, broadcast join
  - UDF, Pandas UDF
- [ ] **Hadoop / HDFS** — overview
- [ ] **Hive / Trino / Presto** — SQL over big data

## 🌬️ Orchestration and Pipelines

- [ ] **Apache Airflow** — gold standard in Russia
  - DAG, operators, sensors, TaskFlow API
  - XCom, branching, dynamic DAGs
- [ ] **dbt** — transformations in DWH
- [ ] Alternatives: Prefect, Dagster

## 📨 Streaming

- [ ] **Apache Kafka** (producers/consumers, topics, partitions)
- [ ] Spark Streaming / Flink (overview)
- [ ] Use case: online features for ML, real-time inference

## ✅ Checkpoint project

An ETL pipeline in Airflow:
1. Pulls data from a public API, for example hh.ru vacancies.
2. Cleans/enriches it in PySpark.
3. Loads it into PostgreSQL and ClickHouse.
4. Builds a data mart for a dashboard (Superset/Metabase).
5. Deploys through `docker-compose`.
