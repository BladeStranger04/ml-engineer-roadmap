# 🤖 4. Classical ML

> Russian version: [04_classical_ml.md](../ru/04_classical_ml.md)

> The base of everything. In Russian interviews, classical ML is asked **very deeply**, especially boosting, because **CatBoost** was made at Yandex and is used everywhere.

## 🧠 Algorithms (must-know)

### Supervised
- [ ] **Linear regression** — formula derivation, regularization (Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet)
- [ ] **Logistic regression** — probabilistic interpretation, log-loss
- [ ] **kNN** — metrics, kd-tree
- [ ] **Naive Bayes**
- [ ] **SVM** — kernel trick, soft margin
- [ ] **Decision Trees** — criteria (Gini, entropy, MSE)
- [ ] **Random Forest** — bagging, OOB
- [ ] **Gradient Boosting** — theory, training scheme
  - **XGBoost**
  - **LightGBM**
  - **CatBoost** ← mandatory for the Russian market

### Unsupervised
- [ ] K-Means, K-Means++, MiniBatch
- [ ] Hierarchical clustering
- [ ] DBSCAN, HDBSCAN
- [ ] PCA, t-SNE, UMAP
- [ ] Anomaly detection (Isolation Forest, LOF)

### Recommender Systems
- [ ] Content-based, collaborative filtering
- [ ] Matrix Factorization (ALS, SVD)
- [ ] Implicit / LightFM
- [ ] Two-tower models (introduction)
