## 🧩 Answer Framework

1. **Clarify the task**: business/ML metrics, load, SLA, constraints
2. **Metrics**: business → product → ML offline → ML online
3. **Data**: sources, volume, annotation, labeling, GDPR/152-FZ
4. **Baseline → iterations**: from simple to complex
5. **Features**: feature engineering, feature store
6. **Model**: candidates, choice, validation
7. **Inference**: latency, batching, caching, GPU/CPU
8. **Deployment**: A/B, canary, shadow
9. **Monitoring**: metrics, drift, alerts, retraining
10. **Trade-offs**: what you saved, what you sacrificed

## ✅ What you should be able to do

- Design a **recommendation system** for a marketplace in 60 minutes.
- Explain why **two-tower** is almost always the first candidate for retrieval.
- Compare **online learning vs batch retraining** for a given case.
- Calculate an end-to-end **latency budget**: DB → feature → model → response.
