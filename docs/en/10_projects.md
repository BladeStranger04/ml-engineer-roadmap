## 🏆 What Makes a Project Strong

- ✅ **Real problem**, not an "MNIST classification" tutorial
- ✅ Full cycle: **data → model → deploy → monitoring**
- ✅ Clean code: typing, tests, lint, CI
- ✅ Documentation: **README with an architecture diagram**
- ✅ Metrics and comparison with baseline
- ✅ Demo: video / Telegram bot / hosted service
- ✅ **Reproducibility** (`docker-compose up`)

## 💡 Project Ideas: Junior to Middle

### 🟢 Starter level (1–2 projects during Classical ML)
1. **Apartment price prediction in your city** — CIAN/Avito parsing → CatBoost → SHAP → FastAPI
2. **Resume classifier** — infer candidate grade from vacancy text via hh.ru API
3. **Churn prediction** on an open dataset → MLflow + Airflow for retraining

### 🟡 Middle level (Deep Learning)
4. **CV classification / detection** on your own dataset: plant species, road signs, etc.
5. **NLP review classification** in Russian with RuBERT fine-tuning
6. **Your own nanoGPT** trained on a Russian literature corpus, with process notes in README

### 🔴 "They will consider you for Middle" level
7. **🔥 RAG bot over your own domain knowledge base** — Qdrant + GigaChat/YandexGPT + Telegram
8. **🔥 Recommender** for anime/movies/books — two-tower + ANN (FAISS) + A/B simulation
9. **🔥 End-to-end MLOps platform** — model + DVC + MLflow + k8s + Prometheus + Evidently
10. **🔥 Fine-tune Saiga/T-lite through LoRA** for a concrete task + vLLM serving + quality benchmark

### 🤖 Robotics + ML, if the area is interesting
11. **RL agent** for a manipulator in simulation (Isaac Sim / MuJoCo)
12. **Robot CV**: detection + tracking + grasp prediction
13. **VLA (Vision-Language-Action)** — mini RT-2-like project in simulation
